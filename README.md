Golden Rules of Scientific Writing | My Personal list of experiences

### Golden rules of scientific writing
1.	Be clear, focused and precise without sacrificing the meaning of your sentences
2.	Keep paragraphs and sentences short. Less is more !
3.	Avoid unnecessary jargon
4.	Use personal pronouns – I/we for self promotion
5.	Frame and contextualize (place in proper context) 
6.	Let your reader know what you are writing about and why you are writing about
7.	Define all terms at the first time
8.	Simplify your paper to not lose your reader
9.	Readers should find it very easy to understand your paper, They should be readily able to absorb the methods you are explaining else they will lose interest and find an alternate
10.	Keep the reader in your grip.
11.	Focus only on one thought that your reader did not have before. Reader should be provoked by just one thought
12.	Do not say what you do not need to say in your paper

### Paper Compression strategy: – 
- The precision comes from **_“selection”_** not from **_“compression”_** or pruning.
-	**First Draft** - Build a good story frame. Nothing should be repeated in your paper. Repetition means inefficiency
-	Do NOT repeat things at different places in your paper.
-	First Draft - When your paper is compact and condensed after your self-review, then decide what words you can get rid of.
-	Formula for Second review - *Second Draft = First Draft – 10%*
-	Avoid – redundancies, pretentious words, words that add no meaning or little meaning.
-	Don’t present the things that are already well known. There is no need to lecture people about the things they already know.

### Hedging Strategies – *When you have to express doubt or uncertainty on your Research Results*
1.	Hedging represents professional modesty, professional purism, express unsurety of findings
2.	When you avoid Hedge words, then you demonstrate that you are absolutely confident of your results used in your paper. 
3.	If you have confidence in your research then you should not use hedge words. This will help your readers find more trust in your words.
4.	Reader should not go to the end of your sentence and start re-reading your sentence.
5.	Editors of High ranked journals do not allow more than 5-6 hedging constructs in your paper.
